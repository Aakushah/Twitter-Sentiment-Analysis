# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## Overview

This project performs sentiment analysis on a dataset of tweets to determine the sentiment of each tweet as either negative, neutral, or positive. The dataset used is the **Sentiment140** dataset, which contains 1,600,000 tweets extracted using the Twitter API.

## Dataset

The Sentiment140 dataset is used for training and testing the sentiment analysis model. The dataset consists of 1,600,000 tweets, each annotated with a sentiment label:

- **0** = Negative sentiment
- **2** = Neutral sentiment
- **4** = Positive sentiment

### Dataset Fields

The dataset contains the following six fields:

- **target**: The polarity of the tweet (0 = negative, 2 = neutral, 4 = positive)
- **ids**: The unique ID of the tweet (e.g., 2087)
- **date**: The date and time the tweet was posted (e.g., Sat May 16 23:58:44 UTC 2009)
- **flag**: The query used to gather the tweet. If no query was used, this value is `NO_QUERY`.
- **user**: The Twitter username of the person who posted the tweet (e.g., robotickilldozr)
- **text**: The actual content of the tweet (e.g., "Lyx is cool")

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following components:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the tweet text for sentiment analysis by removing noise, such as URLs, mentions, hashtags, and special characters.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing the distribution of sentiments, tweet lengths, and other relevant features.

- **Model Training**: Training a machine learning model (such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or a deep learning model) to classify the sentiment of tweets based on their text.

- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

- **Prediction**: Using the trained model to predict the sentiment of new, unseen tweets.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following Python packages:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `nltk`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `tensorflow` (if using a deep learning model)

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk matplotlib seaborn tensorflow
```

## How to Run

1. **Download the Dataset**: Download the Sentiment140 dataset from Kaggle.

2. **Preprocess the Data**: Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data.

3. **Train the Model**: Train the sentiment analysis model using the preprocessed data.

4. **Evaluate the Model**: Evaluate the model's performance on a test set.

5. **Make Predictions**: Use the trained model to predict the sentiment of new tweets.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/twitter-sentiment-analysis.git
   cd twitter-sentiment-analysis
   ```

2. **Preprocess the Data**:

   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```

3. **Train the Model**:

   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

4. **Evaluate the Model**:

   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```

5. **Make Predictions**:

   ```bash
   python predict.py --text "xxxxxxxxxx"
   ```

## Results

The trained model achieves an accuracy of approximately XX% on the test set. Detailed evaluation metrics and visualizations can be found in the `results` directory.
